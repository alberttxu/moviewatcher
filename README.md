# moviewatcher
Inspired by David Mastronarde's framewatcher.

moviewatcher monitors the current working directory for any files with the mrcs or tif/tiff extensions.

## Usage: moviewatcher.py -c/--command COMMAND -d/--dest DEST

COMMAND  Command file for MotionCor2

DEST     Directory to move each initial mrcs/tif file after MotionCor2 finishes processing it. A new folder will be created if DEST does not already exist.


*./moviewatcher.py --command command_file.txt --dest done_folder*


## Command file syntax:

The syntax is sh shell with a few differences.

  * (filename)  is replaced with a discovered mrcs/tif file. e.g. *Falcon_2012_06_12-15_56_10_0_movie.mrcs*

  * (basename)  same as (filename) minus the extension. e.g. *Falcon_2012_06_12-15_56_10_0_movie*

  * (dest)      is replaced with the --dest argument in the moviewatcher command. e.g. *done_folder*
